    "When it comes to using LLMs to draft contracts, it's important to consider that contracts are often lengthy documents, sometimes spanning over 100 pages. This renders conversation-based applications impractical, as LLMs cannot generate such extensive documents, and users prefer not to interact directly with the LLM and manage its outputs themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a potential approach for an application to draft contracts: Rather than expecting the LLM to generate the entire document at once, we can break it down into manageable sections. Users could provide bullet points for each section, allowing the LLM to formulate the corresponding paragraphs and suggest a title for each section. Additionally, in practical scenarios, it's likely necessary to grant the LLM access to specific laws or legal references in some manner."
